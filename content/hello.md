## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
To whomever is reading, welcome! This is my blog! It uses Tailwind, nuxt, scss and other stuff like that, and is generally epic! This post is written in markdown, and is compiled using Nuxt Content! 

## About me
In the likely uncommon senario that you just stumbled upon this blog through google, or my github profile, or something like that, and you don't know who I am then here it is!

<Callout>I am a 16 year old coder, I like coding in Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS and working with Vue.js, socket.io, and Nuxt! I also make some epic browser extensions, discord bots, canvas particle effects and other things of that nature.</Callout>

Anyways, that's about it for now! Here's a nice big button for you to click:
